# 🧹 Clean up on aisle R! 

In lesson 8, we learned about about subsetting with `dplyr` (`select()` & `filter()`). This week we’ll prepare data for analysis by creating or modifying columns. We’ll use `mutate()` (a dplyr verb) together with `ifelse()` (a `base R` function) for quick recoding. You’ll see this duo—mutate() + ifelse()—in nearly every data project. `dplyr` also offers `case_when()` for multi-category recodes; we’ll meet it later.

To begin Lesson 9, follow these steps:

1. Open your course project for RStudio 
   
2. Create a new file. From the file types we have used so far, pick which file type you want to use. (File > New File > RMarkdown (.Rmd) | Quarto Document (.qmd)).

3. Type in the code provided in this document as you follow along with the video. Pause the video at anytime to answer assignment questions, dig deeper or add memo notes.

**Lesson Overview**

By the end of Lesson 9 you will be able to:

1. ⚡ Remember – State the purposes of `mutate()` and `ifelse()`.

2. 🔍 Understand – Explain how `ifelse()` replaces values based on a test.

3. 🛠 Apply – Overwrite or add columns using `mutate()` + `ifelse()`

4. 📊 Analyze – Build multi‑level recodes with nested `ifelse()`.

5. 🧠️ Evaluate – Choose between overwriting vs. keeping the original data.

Keep these goals in mind as you move through each section.

# 📦 Packages

Install once (if needed): `install.packages("dplyr")`; `install.packages("dslabs")`

Load the packages at the start of every session:

```{r , eval=FALSE}
library(dslabs)  # Data science labs package
library(dplyr)   # Data manipulation package
```

# Warm‑Up

1. Logical Test Review

🎯 Goal: To write a simple logical test for numbers one through five showing TRUE for when the numbers are larger than 3.

💬 Prediction: Which numbers do you expect to see `TRUE` for?

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# ⚡Code: TRUE appears where the test is met.
c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) > 3
```

✅ Check / 🗣 Comment:  Did the output met your expectation?

2. `sample()` Review

Recall `sample()` is a `base-R` function that randomly selects elements from a vector.

🎯 Goal: Randomly select 5 numbers from 1 to 10.

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# ⚡Code: 
set.seed(99)  # Ensures reproducibility
sample(1:10, 5)  # Sample 5 numbers from 1 to
```

✅ Check / 🗣 Comment: Confirm the output length is 5 and numbers are between 1 and 10.

# `sample_n()` 

📜 The SYNTAX:`sample_n(data, size, replace = FALSE, weight = NULL)`

🎯 Goal: Randomly select 5 rows from the `mtcars` dataset.

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# ⚡Code: 
sample_n(mtcars, 5)  # Sample 5 rows from mtcars data frame
```

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# ⚡Code: 
mtcars %>% sample_n(5)  # Using with pipe
```

✅ Check / 🗣 Comment: Confirm the output has 5 rows and all original columns.

🤔 Reflect: Why are the selected row numbers different each time you run the code?

We'll come back to `sample_n()` latter in this lesson. 

# `ifelse()`

`ifelse()` tests the data.

📜 The SYNTAX: `ifelse(test, yes, no)`

- *test*  – logical vector (`TRUE`/`FALSE`/`NA`)

- *yes*   – value to insert where test is `TRUE`

- *no*    – value to insert where test is `FALSE` or `NA`

🎯 Goal: Label numbers > 3 as "Big" and others as "Small".

💬 Prediction: I expect to see a vector of "Small" and "Big" labels. Specifically, I expect only 4 and 5 to be "Big".

```{r , eval=FALSE}
ifelse(test = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) > 3, yes = "Big", no = "Small")
```

✅ Check / 🗣 Comment: Confirm the output positions for 1:3 are "Small"  and 4:5 are "Big".

# Multi‑Level Recoding 

Nested `ifelse()`

🎯 Goal: Re-code numbers 1 to 5 as "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", or "Five".

💬 Prediction: I expect to see a vector of the words "One" through "Five" corresponding to the numbers 1 through 5.

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# ⚡Code: 
object2 <- c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5)
length(object2) # Check the length of object2
```


```{r , eval=FALSE}
ifelse(object2 == 1, "One",
       ifelse(object2 == 2, "Two",
              ifelse(object2 == 3, "Three",
                     ifelse(object2 == 4, "Four", "Five"))))
```


✅ Check / 🗣 Comment:  Confirm the output length is 10 and the labels match the numbers.

🤔 Reflect: Why didn’t we need an explicit test for 5? 

You will apply this nested `ifelse()` in task 3 of the assignment.

# `mutate()`

`mutate()` is a function that adds new columns or modifies existing ones

📜 The SYNTAX: `mutate(data, new_col = value)`

## Overwrite Columns

### Copy A Column

🎯 Goal: Create a new column that is a copy of an existing column.

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# Preview Column Names
names(mtcars) # Check the column names
```


💬 Prediction: In a new data set called `mtcars2`, a **new** column named `new_column_copy` is created that is identical to the `am` column.

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# ⚡ Code: 
mtcars2 <- mtcars %>% 
  mutate(new_column_copy = am)
```

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# ✅ Verify:
names(mtcars2) # Check the column names again
```

🗣 Comment: Did you see the new column in the output?

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# ✅ Verify: is am == to n_column_copy?
mtcars2$am == mtcars2$new_column_copy
```


```{r , eval=FALSE}
# ✅ Verify: is am identical to new_column_copy?
identical(mtcars2$am, mtcars2$new_column_copy)
```

🗣 Comment: `mutate(new_column_copy = am)` created an identical column of `am` called `new_column_copy`

### Overwrite Original Column Values

🎯 Goal: Recode the `am` column in `mtcars` from 0/1 to "Automatic"/"Manual".

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# Check the unique values in the am column BEFORE
unique(mtcars$am) 
```

💬 Prediction: In a new data set called `cars_overwrite`, the `am` column is changed from 0/1 to "Automatic"/"Manual". In a second new data set called `cars_keep`, a **new** column named `transmission` is created that has "Automatic"/"Manual" values, while the original `am` column remains unchanged.

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# ⚡ Code: 
cars_overwrite <- mtcars %>%
  mutate(am = ifelse(am == 0, "Automatic", "Manual"))
```

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# ✅ Verify:
unique(cars_overwrite$am)
```

### New Column & New Values

🎯 Goal: Create a new column `transmission` that recodes `am` from 0/1 to "Automatic"/"Manual", while keeping the original `am` column unchanged.

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# ⚡ Code: 
cars_keep <- mtcars %>%
  mutate(transmission = ifelse(am == 0, "Automatic", "Manual"))
```

🗣 Comment: What is the difference between the code that creates `cars_overwrite` and `cars_keep`?

🪞 Metacognition: Why might you want to create a copy of a column when changing the values?

## Editing Starts HERE

```{r , eval=FALSE}
cars_overwrite$am
```
```{r , eval=FALSE}
cars_overwrite %>% select(am)
```
```{r , eval=FALSE}
cars_keep$transmission
```

## Overwrite with Factors

Let's create a sample of the `movielens` dataset using `sample_n()` in to practice overwriting a column variables.

```{r , eval=FALSE}
data("movielens")
?movielens
```

```{r , eval=FALSE}
set.seed(99)

# Sample 100 movies from the movielens dataset
smaller_movies <- movielens %>% 
  sample_n(100) %>% 
  select(title, rating)

head(smaller_movies)
```

We'll apply `mutate()` to `smaller_movies` to recode the rating column to "Good" or "Bad".

📜 The SYNTAX: `mutate(data, new_col = ifelse(test, yes, no))`

```{r , eval=FALSE}
names(smaller_movies) # Check the column names)
movies_overwrite <- smaller_movies %>%
  mutate(rating = ifelse(rating >= 4, "Good", "Bad"))
head(movies_overwrite)
```

👉 Overwriting keeps the column name but changes its contents.

## Bonus Example

```{r , eval=FALSE}
smaller_movies %>%
  mutate(rating_label = ifelse(rating >= 4, "Good", "Bad"))
head(movies_newcol) -> movies_newcol
```

🧐 NOTICE: What is happening here `-> movies_newcol`?

🛠Break Things! How can you reorganize this script? 

## Calculations

🚗 Using `mtcars`, let's use create a column `l_per_100km` that converts from US units (miles per gallon) to metric units (liters per 100km). 235.215 is the conversion factor between these units

- `round(..., 1)` rounds to 1 decimal place

```{r , eval=FALSE}
mtcars_units <- mtcars %>%
  mutate(l_per_100km = round(235.215 / mpg, 1))
head(mtcars_units)
```

👀 Check‑in: Which car is most fuel‑efficient in l/100 km terms?

# 📝 Practice Space

✍️ Practice: Recode the mpg column. Use `mutate()` and `ifelse()`

Fill in the Blanks

```{r , eval=FALSE}
mtcars %>%
  _____(mpg_class = _____(mpg > 25, "High MPG",
                            _____(mpg < 15, "Low MPG", "Medium MPG"))) -> mpg_recode
View(mpg_recode)
```

# ➤ Assignment

Replace each ____ placeholder with working code or a short written answer. Run each section; be sure the requested objects appear in the Environment. When finished, submit lesson notes with assignment in one script (.Rmd / .qmd) along with the `.RData` workspace.

Template (use around every code chunk):

🎯/❓ Goal. One sentence stating the outcome.

💬 Prediction. (Optional) What you expect to see before you run code.

```{r}
#⚡Code attempts.

# your code here
```

✅Checks (before/after). Show what you’re verifying (names, head(), table(), class(), etc.).

🗣/🪞What I learned / Next step. 1–2 sentences.

## Task 1

📦 Library it up!

Make sure there is script in your document to load `dplyr` and `dslabs` packages so their functions / datasets load.

## Task 2

📝  Recode ranges (overwrite)

Using `quakes`, recode `mag` into THREE ordered levels of _your choice_ (e.g., "Low", "Mid", "High") **overwriting** the original column. Use `mutate()` and `ifelse()` chain and pipe (`%>%`). Store as **`quake_recode`**.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
____ <- _____
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Quick check
table(quake_recode$mag)   # should show exactly 3 levels
```

## Task 3

Recode categories (new col)

🌟 With `stars`, turn the one-letter *type* into a descriptive phrase of your own in a **new** column called `full_type`.  Keep the original type. Store as **stars_recode**.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
____ <- _____
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Quick check
head(select(stars_recode, type, full_type))
```

## Task 4

Unit conversion

Create `international_friendly_heights` by adding a `height_cm` column to heights (inches × 2.54). Leave original height.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
____ <- _____
```

🤔 Reflect: Why add—not overwrite—the height column?
