# Introduction

This thirty minute lab activity will turn your questions into next steps with the help of a peer. Before you begin, completely review the Courage Lab document. 

Points: Earn up to 2 learning skill points for participating in this activity. 

⏱️ 30 minute plan at a glance

 - 0-7 min — Question Inventory (2–3 items)

 - 7-22 min — Partner Work (or solo) on one question

 - 22-30 min — Submission
 
If you don’t have questions, be a 🚑 helper for someone who does to earn learning skill points.

# 🔎 Quiet review

Please take 7 minutes to review your scores & comments, and create a question inventory:

1. Open RStudio. *Hint*: If you have a course project, open it.

2. Start a new R script named `courage_lab.R`and title it in the file `# Courage Lab`: 

```{r}
# Courage Lab 
# Your First and Last Name

# Question Inventory (template)

# 1) Source: ____   My question:
#    Code or error:

# 2) Source: ____   My question:
#    Code or error:
```

3. Open Canvas ► Grades 

- Look at Assignments 1 & 2 and Class Activity 1 & 2 comments.

```{r}
# Source: Instructor Comments 

## Do you have questions about the course?
## Do you have questions about the points you earned?
## Do you have questions about the instructor comments?
## Additionally, feel free to provide the instructor feedback about the course in this space. 
```

4. Open your completed assignments in R Studio and review.

⚠️ Common Pain Points:

- Jot anything that’s unclear in your R script.

- Identify any unanswered questions.

- Identify code that you do not understand.

```{r}
# Source: Assignment 1 & 2 Questions

## Did you ask questions in memos but did not or could not answer them?
## Did you write code that you do not understand and could not explain?
## Did you have unresolved errors?
```
```{r}
# Source: Assignment 3 Questions

## Did you ask questions in memos but did not or could not answer them?
## Did you write code that you do not understand and could not explain?
## Did you have unresolved errors?
```

5. No questions yet? Open up the Class Activity 1 & 2 HTML: Vector Playlab 🎮 class activity handout

```{r}
# Source: Vector Playlab

## Your question(s) could be to complete the 5 Dataframes, 6 Matrices, and/or 7 Lists
```

6. Choose your question

- From the list of questions, select *at least* one question you want to answer today. 

# 🤝 Partner Work

Form 👥 pairs (or work solo if you prefer). Record the name of your partner. Choose **one** R coding question to pursue first.

```{r}
# Partner Name (if any): 
```

**Record:**

1. 🧩 **Error** Reproduce the issue. Comment it out.  

2. 🪞 **Memo** Add a reflection about the discovery and learning process. 

3. 🔁 **Change one thing**, re-run, and record what happened (try **two** new strategies).  

4. 📚 **Use resources:** `?function` in RStudio Help, textbook, instructor, boisestate.ai, web search (*try Substack*), other peers. Remember to document resources and how you use them.  

5. 🗣️ **Explain your code in plain English.** If it’s beyond our current skill level, annotate line-by-line. Rewrite the code within your skill level.


**Helper role template** Log who you helped and what you explained.

```{r}
# Helper Log
# I helped: ________   On: ________
# What I explained / what changed:
```

**Reflection Prompts** 

```{r}
# Reflection (3–4 sentences):
# - What failed or confused me?
# - What changed after my two tries?
# - What I learned / my next step:
```

# ✅ Submit

Each person uploads one R script to Class Activity 3 named `courage_lab.R`
