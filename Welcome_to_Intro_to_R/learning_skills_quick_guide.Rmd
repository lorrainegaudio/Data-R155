This guide summarizes the key learning skills we expect you to develop in this course.  
Many of these skills and definitions were inspired by *Deep in Thought: A Practical Guide to Teaching for Intellectual Virtues* [@baehr2022deep].

learning_skills <- tribble(
  ~Skill, ~Meaning, ~Example,
  "Curiosity",
  "Asking new, relevant questions and investigating them beyond what’s assigned.",
  "“While completing Q3, I wondered if the trend would look different by gender. I created an extra plot splitting the data by `gender` to see.”",
  "Autonomy",
  "Taking initiative and making choices about your learning path, rather than waiting for exact instructions.",
  "“Instead of using the dataset in the example, I found a similar one from [source] so I could practice the same function on fresh data.”",
  "Thoroughness",
  "Clearly documenting your steps and reasoning so someone else can follow your process.",
  "“I tried two different ways to calculate the mean: `mean()` and `summarise()`. I noted both in my code with comments and explained why I chose to keep the `summarise()` method.”",
  "Open-mindedness",
  "Considering and testing alternative methods or perspectives, even if you already have a working answer.",
  "“After getting the result with `lm()`, I also tested a robust regression with `rlm()` to see if outliers were affecting my slope.”",
  "Courage",
  "Speaking up with ideas or questions, especially when you’re unsure, and sharing your work for feedback.",
  "“In class, I asked my partner to check my code because I wasn’t sure if my use of `mutate()` was efficient. Their suggestion helped me simplify it.”",
  "Tenacity",
  "Persisting through difficulties, revising code, and knowing when to seek help after genuine effort.",
  "“It took me three tries to debug the error in Q5. I checked my syntax, then my variable names, and finally Googled the error message before finding the typo.”",
  "Transparency",
  "Disclosing methods, materials, assumptions, values, and interests.",
  "“I used boisestate.ai to figure out the error \"Error in `mutate()`: object 'x' not found\" in my code. It was due to a missing package, which I installed. I noted this in my code comments.”"
